Here is a documentation of the dapp.
It may contain the idea of our dapp, the guideline of the work and the input, output and process.


Installing Dependencies: (in ubuntu)
1. Node.js
	sudo apt install nodejs

2. npm
	sudo apt install npm

Above of two dependencies are for installing Truffle. 


3. Truffle
	sudo npm install -g truffle

Truffle framework allow us to create decentralized applications on eth blockchain. It contains a suite of tool for developing smart contacts with Solidity programming language. Besides, it enable us to test our smart contracts and deploy them to blockchain. 

4. Ganache
https://truffleframework.com/ganache

User need to download Ganache first. Then, set the permission to be executable. In linux (ubuntu), right click the file --> properties --> permissions and tick "Allow executing file as program" 
Finally, you double click it again. 

This is a local in-memory blockfchain. It provide us 10 external accounts with addresses on local ethereum blockchain. Each account has its own address, balance (ETH), TX count, index and private key. 

5. Metamask

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en

Using google chrome to download this extension. 

If you do not install google chrome, here is a link to google chrome download page:
https://www.google.com/chrome/

This is a extension for Google Chrome. This extension can allow the user to be connected to their own local ethereum blockchain and decentrailized web. 

6. Sublime Text with ethereum package (optional)

Sublime: https://www.sublimetext.com/
Ethereum package : https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Ethereum

Here is an instruction to download and install this package:
	1. go to https://packagecontrol.io/installation
	2. follow the manual or simple method 
	3. restart sublime text
	4. Ctrl + Shift + P and input "Package Control: Install Package"
	5. Input "ethereum" and verify if the version is same as https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Ethereum

Since most editor or IDE do not provide the syntax highlighting for Ethereum, it is recommended to use Sublime text with ethereum package that can provide the syntax highlighting for Solidity. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing all of dependency:
1. Create a folder for a new project
2. Open the command line and input "truffle unbox pet-shop"  (which will create a truffle project)
3. In command line that located to the project, input "subl ."
4. If it does not have folder explorer, click "View" --> "Side bar" --> "Show Side Bar" and "Show Open File"
5. you will see the frame you have downloaded. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is the whole truffle project's ("pet-shop") structure: 
1. folder "contracts" --> "Migrations.sol" which is the a default contract. Contains the Solidity source files for our smart contracts. 

2. folder "migrations" --> "initial_migration.js" which is for deploying and handling "Migration.sol". Truffle uses a migration system to handle smart contract deployments.
 
3. folder "test" --> some js, png, json file, contains both JavaScript and Solidity tests for our smart contracts.
